👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Arocha  

I’m a junior web developer focused on strengthening my JavaScript fundamentals, building interactive front-end applications, and learning how real-world UI problems are solved.

Right now, I’m working on small projects that emphasize:
- JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation  
- Clean, readable code  
- Practical problem-solving over tutorials  

I’m open to collaborating on beginner-friendly projects where I can contribute, learn, and improve alongside others.
